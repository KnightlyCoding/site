# Knightly Coding

If you have a general understanding of programming, then all you need to start programming in Java is a syntax cheatsheet.
If you have this open while you code, you will be able to quickly and easily write a Java progarm.

## Creating Files

Java files end in `.java`. All java files must have a class:
```java
public class Main {

}
```
The class name must be the name of the file (with the `.java` omitted).

## Variables

In Java, variables must be preceded by a type. Types include:
- `boolean`: a variable that is always either `true` or `false`.
- `int`: a number that is not a decimal (Ex. 1, 0, -1)
- `String`: text (Ex. "hello")
- `char`: a single character (Ex. 'A')
- `float`: a number that can be a decimal (Ex. -1.0, 7.2)
- `double`: a number that can be a decimal (stores twice as many digits as float)

Before the variable type, you may indicate if the variable is `private` or `public`. Private variables can not be accessed outside of the class, whereas public variables can.
Variables can also be indicated to be `static`. `static` variables are shared among all objects at the class level.

## Functions

Java Functions have a type, can be declared as `private` or `public`, and can be declared as `static` (all as metioned above).
```java
public class Main {
    static int a = 5;
    static int b = 10;

    int add() {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

The `return` statement is required for functions of a type. The two ints in the example above are static so that they can be accessed by the add() function.
Functions that don't return a type are implemented with type `void`. Here's an example:
```java
public class Main {
    static int a = 5;
    static int b = 10;
    static int c;

    void add() {
        c = a + b;
    }
}
```

When a Java program is run, the main function is run. Here's an example:
```java
public class Main {
    static int a = 5;
    static int b = 10;

    static int add() {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(add());
    }
}
```

When this program is run, the int 15 will be printed out (System.out.println() is the function for printing).
Note: the syntax `public static void main(String[] args) {}` is requred for the main function.

Functions can also take in parameters. Example:
```java
public class Main {
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        retunr a + b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(add(5, 10));
    }
}
```

## Objects

You can create an object by using a constructor. Example:
```java
public class Object {
    public Object() {}
}
```
```java
public class Main {
    Object a = new Object();
}
```

Note: Main and Object are in two different files.
Here's an example of how to use an Object:
```java
package folder;

public class Calculator {
    static int a;
    static int b;

    public Calculator(int ap, int bp) {
        a = ap;
        b = bp;
    }

    public static int add() {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static int multiply() {
        return a * b;
    }

    public static int subtract() {
        return a - b;
    }

    public static double divide() {
        return a / b;
    }
}
```
```java
import Calculator.java;

public class Main {
    static Calculator calculator = new Calculator(5, 10);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(calculator.add());
        System.out.println(calculator.multiply());
        System.out.println(calculator.subtract());
        System.out.println(calculator.divide());
    }
}
```

This would return:
```
15
50
-5
0.5
```

Note: the above code uses imports. Read below section to learn more.

## Importing Code

To use an object from a different file, you must import it.
```java
import folder/Calculator.java;

public class Main {}
```

In this example, Main.java is in the folder "folder." If Main.java and Calculator.java were in the same folder, you could import a package:
```java
package folder;

public class Main{}
```
