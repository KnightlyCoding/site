# Knightly Coding

This cheat-sheet is for those who have a general understanding of programming. Keep this open while you code for easy Java-programming.

## Key Notes

- All lines end in semicolons.
- Varaibles and functions must have a declared type. The different types are:
    - `boolean`: a variable that is always either `true` or `false`.
    - `int`: a number that is not a decimal (Ex. 1, 0, -1)
    - `String`: text (Ex. "hello")
    - `char`: a single character (Ex. 'A')
    - `float`: a number that can be a decimal (Ex. -1.0, 7.2)
    - `double`: a number that can be a decimal (stores twice as many digits as float)
- Before the variable or function type, you may indicate if the variable is `private` or `public`.
- Functions and variables can also be indicated to be `static` (able to be accessed by other functions).
- Functions must have a return statement that returns a variable of the function type.
    - `int myFunction() {return 5;}`
- Functions that don't return a value are of type void.
    - `void myFunction() {System.out.println("Hello World!");}`

## Java Class

Java files end in `.java`. All java files must have a class.
The class name must be the name of the file (with the `.java` omitted).
When the class is run, the main function is run. Example:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

## Objects & Imports

You can create an object by using a constructor. Example:
```java
package folder;

public class Object {
    public Object() {}
}
```
```java
import Object.java;

public class Main {
    Object a = new Object();
}
```

Note: Main and Object are in two different files and in the same folder ("folder").
The line `public Object() {}` is a constructor. Constructors return no type.
