# Java Quick Guide

If you have a general understanding of programming, then all you need to start programming in Java is a simple quick guide.

## Overview

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={2} />

## Creating Files

Java files end in `.java`. All java files must have a class:
```java
public class Main {

}
```
The class name must be the name of the file (with the `.java` omitted).

## Variables

In Java, variables must be preceded by a type. Types include:
- `boolean`: a variable that is always either `true` or `false`.
- `int`: a number that is not a decimal (Ex. 1, 0, -1)
- `String`: text (Ex. "hello")
- `char`: a single character (Ex. 'A')
- `float`: a number that can be a decimal (Ex. -1.0, 7.2)
- `double`: a number that can be a decimal (stores twice as many digits as float)

Before the variable type, you may indicate if the variable is `private` or `public`. Private variables can not be accessed outside of the class, whereas public variables can.
Variables can also be indicated to be `static`. `static` variables are shared among all objects at the class level.

## Functions

Java Functions have a type, can be declared as `private` or `public`, and can be declared as `static` (all as metioned above).
```java
public class Main {
    static int a = 5;
    static int b = 10;

    int add() {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

The `return` statement is required for functions of a type. The two ints in the example above are static so that they can be accessed by the add() function.
Functions that don't return a type are implemented with type `void`. Here's an example:
```java
public class Main {
    static int a = 5;
    static int b = 10;
    static int c;

    void add() {
        c = a + b;
    }
}
```

When a Java program is run, the main function is run. Here's an example:
```java
public class Main {
    static int a = 5;
    static int b = 10;

    static int add() {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(add());
    }
}
```

When this program is run, the int 15 will be printed out (System.out.println() is the function for printing).
Note: the syntax `public static void main(String[] args) {}` is requred for the main function.

Functions can also take in parameters. Example:
```java
public class Main {
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        retunr a + b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(add(5, 10));
    }
}
```

## Objects

You can create an object by using a constructor. Example:
```java
public class Object {
    public Object() {}
}
```
```java
public class Main {
    Object a = new Object();
}
```

Note: Main and Object are in two different files.
Here's an example of how to use an Object:
```java
package folder;

public class Calculator {
    static int a;
    static int b;

    public Calculator(int ap, int bp) {
        a = ap;
        b = bp;
    }

    public static int add() {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static int multiply() {
        return a * b;
    }

    public static int subtract() {
        return a - b;
    }

    public static double divide() {
        return a / b;
    }
}
```
```java
import Calculator.java;

public class Main {
    static Calculator calculator = new Calculator(5, 10);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(calculator.add());
        System.out.println(calculator.multiply());
        System.out.println(calculator.subtract());
        System.out.println(calculator.divide());
    }
}
```

This would return:
```
15
50
-5
0.5
```

Note: the above code uses imports. Read below section to learn more.

## Importing Code

To use an object from a different file, you must import it.
```java
import folder/Calculator.java;

public class Main {}
```

In this example, Main.java is in the folder "folder." If Main.java and Calculator.java were in the same folder, you could import a package:
```java
package folder;

public class Main{}
```

## If Statements

In Java, `if` statements check a condition. They can also include `if else` statements and/or `else` statements. Example:
```java
if (x > 10) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than ten.");
} else if (x < 10) {
    System.out.println("x is less than 10.")
} else {
    System.out.println("x is equal to 10.")
}
```

Conditions in `if` statements are booleans. They can use a boolean variable or an equality (Ex. x > 6, x == 6, x != 6).
Switch statements are alternatives to if statements for when you are checking for many different values of a variable. Example:
```java
switch(day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("It's Monday!");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("It's Tuesday!");
        break;
    case 3:
        System.out.println("It's Wednesday!");
        break;
    case 4:
        System.out.println("It's Thursay!");
        break;
    case 5:
        System.out.println("It's Friday!");
        break;
    case default:
        System.out.println("It's the weekend!");
        break;
}
```
Note: default is a catch-all case for anything that is not one of the above cases.
The `break` key word tells the code to jump to the end of the switch statement after the case returns true.

## Arrays

Arrays are another variable type. They are essentaily a list of variables. Example:
```java
public class Main {
    static char[] alphabet = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'};

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(alphabet[0]);
    }
}
```
This would return `a`.
Each value of an array has an index, starting at 0 then going up by one. In the above example, we print the value at index 0 of the array.
You can change the value of an index of the array, but once it has been initialized, you can't add or remove indexes.

## Loops

In Java, there are `for` loops, `while` loops, and `for` each loops. Here's an example of a `while` loop:
```java
while (x < 3) {
    x++;
}
```

In the above example, the `while` statement takes in a boolean condition and repeats the code inside it until the consition is true.
Note: The `++` is an increment operator, which sets x equal to x + 1. Here's an example of a `for` loop:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

In the above example, the first statement is the iterator variable. The second condition is the boolean that, when it returns true, stops the loop.
The third statement is optional. It increments the iterator so that the loop can end. If your loop does not end, your computer might explode.
Here is an example of a `for` each loop:
```java
for (char letter : alpahbet) {
    System.out.println(letter);
}
```

In `for` each loops, you instantiate a variable whose type corresponds to the type of the array. Then, you put a colon and then an array to loop through.
This example would return:
```
a
b
c
d
etc.
```
